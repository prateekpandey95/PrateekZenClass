JavaScript is a simple programming language which runs in any browser JavaScript Engine. Whereas Node JS is an interpreter or running environment for a JavaScript programming language which holds a lot of excesses require libraries which can easily be accessed from JavaScript programming for better use.

JavaScript is normally used for any client-side activity for one web application. Activity can be addressing business validation or dynamic page display in some schedule time interval or basic Ajax call kind of task. Those are used on a maximum time for any web application. Whereas Node JS mainly used for accessing or running any operating system for non-blocking operation. An operation like create or executing shell script, or getting some specific hardware related information on one call or installed certificate details in the system or lot of define task which are non-blocking on an operating system.

JavaScript running in any engine like Spider monkey (FireFox), JavaScript Core (Safari), V8 (Google Chrome). So JavaScript programming is very easy to write and put any running environment means proper browser. Whereas Node JS only support V8 engine which googles chrome specific. But whether it support V8 engine, written JavaScript code can able to run in any environment. So there has no browser specific constraint on it.

JavaScript is normally following Java Programming language standard. There may have some different way of writing code but at the same time, we can say it following Java Programming language standard. Whereas node JS is written in C++, and provide V8 engine base browser javascript running engine which helps us to run written javascript program in any browser environment.

For accessing any operating system specific non-blocking task JavaScript has some specific object but all of them are operating system specific. An example is ActiveX Control which is only running in Windows. But Node JS is given utility to run some operating system specific non-blocking tasks from any JavaScript programming. It doesnâ€™t have any operating system specific constant. Node JS is very much familiar to create a specific binding with the file system, and also allowing developer for reading or sometimes write on disk.
