In 2015, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) release HTTP/2, the second major version of the most useful internet protocol, HTTP. It was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol.
Main goals of developing HTTP/2 was:
Protocol negotiation mechanism — protocol electing, eg. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or other.
High-level compatibility with HTTP/1.1 — methods, status codes, URIs and header fields.

Page load speed improvements trough:
-Compression of request headers
-Binary protocol
-HTTP/2 Server Push
-Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection
-Request pipelining
-HOL blocking (Head-of-line) — Package blocking
-Request multiplexing


HTTP/2 can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection. This is the most advanced feature of the HTTP/2 protocol because it allows you to download web files asynchronously from one server. Most modern browsers limit TCP connections to one server.
This reduces additional round trip time (RTT), making your website load faster without any optimization, and makes domain sharding unnecessary.
